abstract = {This paper describes one of possible parameter identification approach for a quadrotor. The unknown parameter of the quadrotor will be identified using state estimation method with the implementation of Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). In the identification of state and parameter for nonlinear dynamic system, UKF has grown to be superior techniques. Two main processes highlighted in this paper are dynamic modeling of quadrotor and the implementation of UKF algorithm. The aim is to identify and estimate the needed parameters for an autonomous quadrotor. The obtained results demonstrate the performance of UKF based on the flight test applied to the quadrotor system.},

abstract = {Smart spaces, either public or private, has been a hot topic for more than a decade. They are claimed to bring various advantages for their users. However, only few people are actually using smart spaces. One of the reasons for that is the lack of attention paid to user interfaces used to control the space. Both industrial and academic research is often focused on hardware and device interoperability issues. There is not enough studies about end-user mental models, how and why people want to control and program smart spaces. In this position paper, we propose a strategy of how to bring end-user programming in smart spaces into real life. Our idea is three-fold: 1) concentrate on users' mental models, 2) create intuitive ubiquitous user interface, which combines the direct interaction pattern and the magnetic poetry interface metaphor, and 3) install a control system in a public smart space, where a lot of people can use it on daily basis. We aim to conduct a long term user study, from which we are planning to get unique data about evolution of people's expectations and mental models in the context of smart space control.},

The paper concludes with case studies that illustrate the use of two of the solver frameworks to develop custom solvers for specific problem classes and with benchmarking of the six black box solvers. 1},

It is par- ticularly important for applications where the users context is changing rap- idly, such as in both handheld and ubiquitous computing.

Our focus is on the paradigm of behavioral, scenario-based, programming, as captured by the language of live sequence charts (LSC) or its Java-based counterpart, BPJ. In this programming paradigm, multi-modal behaviors can be specified separately, and are integrated only at run time. We present a tool, with which the user can easily follow the decisions of the collective execution mechanism. It shows the behaviors and events that were executed at each point in time, and those that were delayed or abandoned, as well as the causes and reasons behind these run-time choices. The dynamic effects of such decisions on thesystem's behavior can be seen easily too.},

An omnidirectional fisheye camera is used as a primary sensor, while IMU data is needed for compensating rotational effects of the optical flow.

abstract = {In this paper, we present our latest achievements towards the goal of autonomous flights of an MAV in unknown environments, only having a monocular camera as exteroceptive sensor. As MAVs are highly agile, it is not sufficient to directly use the visual input for position control at the framerates that can be achieved with small onboard computers. Our contributions in this work are twofold. First, we present a solution to overcome the issue of having a low frequent onboard visual pose update versus the high agility of an MAV. This is solved by filtering visual information with inputs from inertial sensors. Second, as our system is based on monocular vision, we present a solution to estimate the metric visual scale aid of an air pressure sensor. All computation is running onboard and is tightly integrated on the MAV to avoid jitter and latencies. This framework enables stable flights indoors and outdoors even under windy conditions.},

The CPS problem is not the union of cyber and physical prob- lems, but rather their intersection, and as such it demands models that embrace both. Two complementary approaches are identified: cyberizing the physical (CtP) means to endow physical subsystems with cyber-like abstractions and inter- faces; and physicalizing the cyber (PtC) means to endow software and network components with abstractions and in- terfaces that represent their dynamics in time.},

abstract = {Reading text safely and easily while mobile has been an issue with see-through displays for many years. For example, in order to effectively use optical see through Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) or Heads Up Display (HUD) systems in constantly changing dynamic environments, variables like lighting conditions, human or vehicular obstructions in a user's path, and scene variation must be dealt with effectively. This paper introduces a new intelligent text management system that actively manages movement of text in a user's field of view. Research to date lacks a method to migrate user-centric content such as e-mail or text messages throughout a user's environment while mobile. Unlike most current annotation and view management systems, we use camera tracking to find dark, uniform regions along the route on which a user is travelling in real time. We then implement methodology to move text from one viable location to the next to maximize readability. A pilot experiment with 19 participants shows that the text placement of our system is preferred to text in fixed location configurations.},

It is widely recognised that$\backslash$nthe quality assurance of software products must be guaranteed from the$\backslash$nearly phases of development. As a key artifact produced in the early$\backslash$ndevelopment of object-oriented (OO) information systems (OOISs), class$\backslash$ndiagram quality has a great impact on the quality of the software$\backslash$nproduct which is finally delivered. Hence, class diagram quality is a$\backslash$ncrucial issue that must be evaluated (and improved if necessary) in$\backslash$norder to obtain quality OOISs, which is the main concern of present-day$\backslash$nsoftware development organisations. After a thorough review of the$\backslash$nexisting OO measures that are applicable to class diagrams at a$\backslash$nhigh-level design stage, M. Genero et al.

@book{Harel2003a,
abstract = {This book presents a powerful new language and methodology for programming complex reactive systems in a scenario-based manner. The language is live sequence charts (LSCs), a multimodal extension of sequence charts and UML's sequence diagrams, used in the past mainly for requirements. The methodology is play-in/play-out, an unusually convenient means for specifying inter-object scenario-based behavior directly from a GUI or an object model diagram, with the surprising ability to execute that behavior, or those requirements, directly. The language and methodology are supported by a fully implemented tool – the Play-Engine – which is attached to the book in CD form.     The design of reactive systems is one of the most challenging problems in computer science. This books starts with a critical insight to explain the problem: there is a fundamental gap between the scenario-based way in which people think about such systems and the state-based way in which these systems are implemented. The book then offers a radical proposal to bridge this gap by means of playing scenarios. Systems can be specified by playing in scenarios and implemented by means of a Play-Engine that plays out scenarios. This idea is carried out and developed, lucidly, formally and playfully, to its fullest. The result is a compelling proposal, accompanied by a prototype software engine, for reactive systems design, which is bound to cause a splash in the software-engineering community. Moshe Vardi, Rice University, Houston, Texas, USA  Scenarios are a primary exchange tool in explaining system behavior to others, but their limited expressive power never made them able to fully describe systems, thus limiting their use. The language of Live Sequence Charts (LSCs) presented in this beautifully written book achieves this goal, and the attached Play-Engine software makes these LSCs really come alive. This is undoubtedly a key breakthrough that will start long-awaited and exciting new directions in systems specification, synthesis, and analysis. G{\'{e}}rard Berry, Esterel Technologies and INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, France The approach of David Harel and Rami Marelly is a fascinating way of combining prototyping techniques with techniques for identifying behavior and user interfaces.

Over the last decade, we have seen a large number of the IoT solutions developed by start-ups, small and medium enterprises, large corporations, academic research institutes (such as universities), and private and public research organisations making their way into the market. In this paper, we survey over one hundred the IoT smart solutions in the marketplace and examine them closely in order to identify their applications and the technologies they use. More importantly, we identify the trends, opportunities and open challenges in the industry-based the IoT solutions. Based on the application domain, we classify and discuss these solutions under five different categories: smart wearable, smart home, smart, city, smart environment, and smart enterprise. This survey is intended to serve as a guideline and conceptual framework for future research in the IoT and to motivate and inspire further developments. It also provides a systematic exploration of existing research and suggests a number of potentially significant research directions.},

Thirdly, the dynamic model is implemented in Matlab/Simulink simulation, and the PID control parameters are obtained according to the simulation results. Finally, a quadrotor with PID controllers is designed and made. In order to do the experiment, a flying experiment for the quadrotor has been done.

Reasoning about actions and plans can be seen as fundamental to the development of intelligent machines that are capable of dealing effectively with real-world problems. This book comprises 17 chapters, with the first delving into the semantics of STRIPS. The following chapters then discuss a theory of plans; formulating multiagent, dynamic-world problems in the classical planning framework; and a representation of parallel activity based on events, structure, and causality. Other chapters cover branching regular expressions and multi-agent plans; a representation of action and belief for automatic planning systems; possible worlds planning; and intractability and time-dependent planning. The remaining chapters discuss goal structure, holding periods and ""clouds""; a model of plan inference that distinguishes between the beliefs of actors and observers; persistence, intention, and commitment; the context-sensitivity of belief and desire; the doxastic theory of intention; an architecture for intelligent reactive systems; and abstract reasoning as emergent from concrete activity. This book will be of interest to practitioners in the fields of cognition and artificial intelligence.},

abstract = {Now widely adopted as the de facto industry standard and sanctioned by the Object Management Group, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a notation all software developers need to know and understand. However, the UML is a big language, and not all of it is equally important. The award-winning first edition of UML Distilled was widely praised for being a concise guide to the core parts of the UML and has proved extremely successful in helping developers get up and running quickly. UML Distilled, Second Edition, maintains the concise format with significantly updated coverage of use cases and activity diagrams, and expanded coverage of collaborations. It also includes a new appendix detailing the changes between UML versions.Written for those with a basic understanding of object-oriented analysis and design, this book begins with a summary of UML's history, development, and rationale and then moves into a discussion of how the UML can be integrated into the object-oriented development process. The primary author profiles the various modeling techniques in the UML--such as use cases, class diagrams, and interaction diagrams--and describes the notation and semantics clearly and succinctly. He also outlines useful non-UML techniques such as CRC cards and patterns. These descriptions are made even more relevant with a collection of best practices based on the primary author's experience and a brief Java programming example demonstrating the implementation of a UML-based design. With this tour of the key parts of the UML, readers will be left with a firm foundation upon which to build models and develop further knowledge of the Unified Modeling Language.Praise for the First Edition"UML Distilled is a recipient of the prestigious 1997 Software Development Magazine Productivity Award in the Books category.

abstract = {A cyber-physical system consists of a collection of computing devices communicating with one another and interacting with the physical world via sensors and actuators in a feedback loop. Increasingly, such systems are everywhere, from smart buildings to medical devices to automobiles. This textbook offers a rigorous and comprehensive introduction to the principles of design, specification, modeling, and analysis of cyber-physical systems. The book draws on a diverse set of subdisciplines, including model-based design, concurrency theory, distributed algorithms, formal methods of specification and verification, control theory, real-time systems, and hybrid systems, explaining the core ideas from each that are relevant to system design and analysis.The book explains how formal models provide mathematical abstractions to manage the complexity of a system design. It covers both synchronous and asynchronous models for concurrent computation, continuous-time models for dynamical systems, and hybrid systems for integrating discrete and continuous evolution. The role of correctness requirements in the design of reliable systems is illustrated with a range of specification formalisms and the associated techniques for formal verification. The topics include safety and liveness requirements, temporal logic, model checking, deductive verification, stability analysis of linear systems, and real-time scheduling algorithms. Principles of modeling, specification, and analysis are illustrated by constructing solutions to representative design problems from distributed algorithms, network protocols, control design, and robotics.This book provides the rapidly expanding field of cyber-physical systems with a long-needed foundational text by an established authority. It is suitable for classroom use or as a reference for professionals.},

The primary goal of this document is to describe an approach for and the mechanics of constructing an architectural model that can be analyzed based on the AADL. The first section of this document presents an overview of AADL concepts and many of the keywords of the language. The second part of the document illustrates a model-building approach using the AADL. It takes the perspective of an engineer who is developing a model for the first time using the AADL. This guide leads the reader through complete AADL model development based on automotive embedded control systems (cruise control, traction control, etc.) by describing the use and syntax of the AADL and interleaving modeling abstraction tradeoffs to achieve models that are abstract but precise. Models are constructed with different analysis perspectives in mind to illustrate the semantics as well as the richness of the AADL.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a versatile framework to enable autonomous flights of a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) which has only slow, noisy, delayed and possibly arbitrar- ily scaled measurements available. Using such measurements directly for position control would be practically impossible as MAVs exhibit great agility in motion. In addition, these measurements often come from a selection of different onboard sensors, hence accurate calibration is crucial to the robustness of the estimation processes. Here, we address these problems using an EKF formulation which fuses these measurements with inertial sensors. We do not only estimate pose and velocity of the MAV, but also estimate sensor biases, scale of the position measurement and self (inter-sensor) calibration in real-time. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to obtain a yaw estimate from position measurements only. We demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of running entirely onboard a MAV performing state prediction at the rate of 1 kHz. Our results illustrate that this approach is able to handle measurement delays (up to 500ms), noise (std. deviation up to 20 cm) and slow update rates (as low as 1 Hz) while dynamic maneuvers are still possible. We present a detailed quantitative performance evaluation of the real system under the influence of different disturbance parameters and different sensor setups to highlight the versatility of our approach.},

abstract = {Recent development showed that Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are nowadays capable of autonomously take off at one point and land at another using only one single camera as exteroceptive sensor. During the flight and landing phase the MAV and user have, however, little knowledge about the whole terrain and potential obstacles. In this paper we show a new solution for a real-time dense 3D terrain reconstruction. This can be used for efficient unmanned MAV terrain exploration and yields a solid base for standard autonomous obstacle avoidance algorithms and path planners. Our approach is based on a textured 3D mesh on sparse 3D point features of the scene. We use the same feature points to localize and control the vehicle in the 3D space as we do for building the 3D terrain reconstruction mesh. This enables us to reconstruct the terrain without significant additional cost and thus in real-time. Experiments show that the MAV is easily guided through an unknown, GPS denied environment. Obstacles are recognized in the iteratively built 3D terrain reconstruction and are thus well avoided.},

We model hybrid systems as finite automata equipped with variables that evolve continuously with time according to dynamical laws. For verification purposes, we restrict ourselves to linear hybrid systems, where all variables follow piecewise-linear trajectories. We provide decidability and undecidability results for classes of linear hybrid systems, and we show that standard program-analysis techniques can be adapted to linear hybrid systems. In particular, we consider symbolic model-checking and minimization procedures that are based on the reachability analysis of an infinite state space. The procedures iteratively compute state sets that are definable as unions of convex polyhedra in multidimensional real space. We also present approximation techniques for dealing with systems for which the iterative procedures do not converge.},

A recently proposed behavioral programming approach, which evolved from the visual language of live sequence charts (LSCs), calls for coding software modules in alignment with such scenarios. We present a methodology and a supporting model-checking tool for verifying behavioral Java programs, without having to first translate them into a specific input language for the model checker. Our method facilitates early discovery of conflicting or under-specified scenarios, which can often be resolved by adding new scenarios rather than by changing existing code. Also, counterexamples provided by the tool are themselves event sequences that can serve directly for refinements and corrections. Our tool reduces the size of the execution state-space using an abstraction that focuses on behaviorally interesting states and treats transitions between them as atomic.},

abstract = {The development of an interactive application is a complex task that has to consider data, behavior, intercommunication, architecture and distribution aspects of the modeled system. In particular it presupposes the successful communication between the customer and the software expert. To enhance this communication most modern software engineering methods recommend specification of the different aspects of a system by visual formalisms. In essence, visual specifications are directed graphs that are interpreted in a particular way for each aspect of the system. They are also intended to be compositional. This means that each node can itself be a graph with a separate meaning. However, the lack of a denotational model for hierarchical graphs often leads to the loss of compositionality. This has severe negative consequences in the development of realistic applications. We present a simple denotational model (which is by definition compositional) for the architecture and behavior aspects of a system. This model is then used to give a semantics to almost all the concepts occurring in ROOM. Our model also provides a compositional semantics for or-states an statecharts},

In their present form, CRT touch panels appear not to be as safe as knobs, push buttons and levers that are currently being used. A tentative design guide is proposed and presented to aid designers in the design and applications of CRT touch panels and sophisticated displays in automobiles which will, hopefully, be more in tune with human capabilities and limitations and will ensure a more adequate and acceptable level of safety and driver performance during their operation while driving along a straight, smooth road with no other traffic close by and no traffic control devices or other obstacles present.},

abstract = {Research into the use of diagrams is an interdisciplinary endeavour, encompassing disciplines as diverse as psychology, architecture and artificial intelligence. It is also a relatively new research area, with the first meeting of like-minded researchers interested in studying diagrams taking place in 1997. Now that diagrams research is more established, it is timely to review its scope, nature and progress. This paper reviews diagrams research over the past twelve years, as represented in the proceedings of the International Conference on the Theory and Application of Diagrams. In summarising the contents of these proceedings, a taxonomy describing the scope of diagrams research is proposed, the several research issues covered are identified, and the extent to which layout and aesthetics form part of this body of research is discussed. In concluding, trends and under-represented areas are noted and discussed. The aim of the paper is not only to summarise the research covered in this particular conference, but to provide a basis for on-going discussion on the changing nature of diagrams research. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Each package is categorized as a black box solver, a callable library, a solver framework, or some combination of these. The distinguishing features of all eight packages are described. The paper concludes with case studies that illustrate the use of two of the solver frameworks to develop custom solvers for specific problem classes and with benchmarking of the six black box solvers. 1},

abstract = {The visual system continuously integrates multiple sensory cues to help plan and control everyday motor tasks. We quantified how subjects integrated monocular cues (contour and texture) and binocular cues (disparity and vergence) about 3D surface orientation throughout an object placement task and found that binocular cues contributed more to online control than planning. A temporal analysis of corrective responses to stimulus perturbations revealed that the visuomotor system processes binocular cues faster than monocular cues. This suggests that binocular cues dominated online control because they were available sooner, thus affecting a larger proportion of the movement. This was consistent with our finding that the relative influence of binocular information was higher for short-duration movements than long-duration movements. A motor control model that optimally integrates cues with different delays accounts for our findings and shows that cue integration for motor control depends in part on the time course of cue processing. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The controllers were applied to a small-sized, torpedo-shaped HAUV with six degrees of freedom The coupling between attitude and position makes the trajectory tracking control problem particularly hard. However, at least in the case of set-point control, it is possible to adopt a two decouple control strategy. A non-linear controller is applied for achieving attitude regulation, while a non-linear control strategy is used for achieving smooth motion back to the desired position coordinates. The performance of the proposed control scheme is evaluated numerically.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been increased interest in the de- velopment of autonomous flying vehicles. However, as most of the proposed approaches are suitable for outdoor operation, only a few techniques have been designed for indoor environments, where the systems cannot rely on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and, therefore, have to use their exteroceptive sensors for navigation. In this paper, we present a general navigation system that enables a small-sized quadrotor system to autonomously operate in indoor environments. To achieve this, we systematically extend and adapt techniques that have been successfully applied on ground robots. We describe all algorithms and present a broad set of experiments, which illustrate that they enable a quadrotor robot to reliably and autonomously navigate in indoor environments.},

abstract = {Eye movements during natural tasks are well coordinated with ongoing task demands and many variables could influence gaze strategies. Sprague and Ballard (2003) proposed a gaze-scheduling model that uses a utility-weighted uncertainty metric to prioritize fixations on task-relevant objects and predicted that human gaze should be influenced by both reward structure and task-relevant uncertainties. To test this conjecture, we tracked the eye movements of participants in a simulated driving task where uncertainty and implicit reward (via task priority) were varied. Participants were instructed to simultaneously perform a Follow Task where they followed a lead car at a specific distance and a Speed Task where they drove at an exact speed. We varied implicit reward by instructing the participants to emphasize one task over the other and varied uncertainty in the Speed Task with the presence or absence of uniform noise added to the car's velocity. Subjects' gaze data were classified for the image content near fixation and segmented into looks. Gaze measures, including look proportion, duration and interlook interval, showed that drivers more closely monitor the speedometer if it had a high level of uncertainty, but only if it was also associated with high task priority or implicit reward. The interaction observed appears to be an example of a simple mechanism whereby the reduction of visual uncertainty is gated by behavioral relevance. This lends qualitative support for the primary variables controlling gaze allocation proposed in the Sprague and Ballard model.},

abstract = {Visions of smart homes have long caught the attention of researchers and considerable effort has been put toward enabling home automation. However, these technologies have not been widely adopted despite being available for over three decades. To gain insight into this state of affairs, we conducted semi-structured home visits to 14 households with home automation. The long term experience, both positive and negative, of the households we interviewed illustrates four barriers that need to be addressed before home automation becomes amenable to broader adoption. These barriers are high cost of ownership, inflexibility, poor manageability, and difficulty achieving security. Our findings also provide several directions for further research, which include eliminating the need for structural changes for installing home automation, providing users with simple security primitives that they can confidently configure, and enabling composition of home devices.},

UAVs are finding applications in various areas ranging from military applications to traffic surveillance. This paper is a survey for a certain kind of UAV called quadrotor or quadcopter. Researchers are frequently choosing quadrotors for their research because a quadrotor can accurately and efficiently perform tasks that would be of high risk for a human pilot to perform. This paper encompasses the dynamic models of a quadrotor and the different model-dependent and model-independent control techniques and their comparison. Recently, focus has shifted to designing autonomous quadrotors. A summary of the various localization and navigation techniques has been given. Lastly, the paper investigates the potential applications of quadrotors and their role in multi-agent systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {), each of which independently describes a scenario that may cross object boundaries. We identify a protocol and a coordination mechanism that allow such behavioral programming. Essentially, runs of programs are sequences of events that result from three kinds of b-thread actions: requesting that events be considered for triggering, waiting for triggered events, and blocking events requested by other b-threads. The coordination mechanism synchronizes and interlaces b-threads execution yielding composite, integrated system behavior. The protocol idioms and the coordination mechanism of b-threads are implemented as a Java library called BPJ. Throughout the exposition we illustrate benefits of the approach and discuss the merits of behavioral programming as a broad, implementation-independent paradigm.},

Unfortunately, the semantics (meaning) of models written in UML is not precisely defined. It may result in the incorrect interpretation of a model and make it hard to strictly verify a model and its transformation. In this paper we formally (mathematically) define UML class diagram and its semantics. The problem of consistency of the diagram is then introduced and some examples of inconsistencies are forwarded},

abstract = {We propose timed (finite) automata to model the behavior of real-time systems over time. Our definition provides a simple, and yet powerful, way to annotate state-transition graphs with timing constraints using finitely many real-valued clocks. A timed automaton accepts timed words-infinite sequences in which a real-valued time of occurrence is associated with each symbol. We study timed automata from the perspective of formal language theory: we consider closure properties, decision problems, and subclasses. We consider both nondeterministic and deterministic transition structures, and both B??chi and Muller acceptance conditions. We show that nondeterministic timed automata are closed under union and intersection, but not under complementation, whereas deterministic timed Muller automata are closed under all Boolean operations. The main construction of the paper is an (PSPACE) algorithm for checking the emptiness of the language of a (nondeterministic) timed automaton. We also prove that the universality problem and the language inclusion problem are solvable only for the deterministic automata: both problems are undecidable (??11-hard) in the nondeterministic case and PSPACE-complete in the deterministic case. Finally, we discuss the application of this theory to automatic verification of real-time requirements of finite-state systems. ?? 1994.},

@article{Berkenkotter2006,
abstract = {In this article, a new UML extension for the specification of hybrid systems, where observables may consist of both discrete and time-continuous parameters, is presented. The construction uses the profile mechanism of UML 2.0 which is the standard procedure for extending the Unified Modeling Language. Whereas hybrid modeling constructs are not available in standard UML, several specification formalisms for this type of system have been elaborated and discussed in the formal methods communities. As a basis for the new UML profile, the authors adopt one of these formalisms – the CHARON language of Alur et. al. – already possessing several attractive features for modeling embedded real-time systems with hybrid characteristics. As a result, the profile inherits the formal CHARON semantics, so it offers the possibility for formal reasoning about hybrid UML specifications. Conversely, CHARON is associated with a new syntactic representation within the UML 2.0 world, allowing to develop hybrid specifications with arbitrary CASE tools supporting UML 2.0 and its profiling mechanism. The “look-and-feel” of the profile is illustrated by means of a case study of an embedded system controlling the cabin illumination in an aircraft. The benefits and weaknesses of the constructed hybrid UML profile are discussed, resulting in feed-back for the improvement of both UML 2.0 and the CHARON formalism.},

abstract = {This paper examines the old question of the relationship between ISWIM and the $\lambda$-calculus, using the distinction between call-by-value and call-by-name. It is held that the relationship should be mediated by a standardisation theorem. Since this leads to difficulties, a new $\lambda$-calculus is introduced whose standardisation theorem gives a good correspondence with ISWIM as given by the SECD machine, but without the letrec feature. Next a call-by-name variant of ISWIM is introduced which is in an analogous correspondence withthe usual $\lambda$-calculus. The relation between call-by-value and call-by-name is then studied by giving simulations of each language by the other and interpretations of each calculus in the other. These are obtained as another application of the continuation technique. Some emphasis is placed throughout on the notion of operational equality (or contextual equality). If terms can be proved equal in a calculus they are operationally equal in the corresponding language. Unfortunately, operational equality is not preserved by either of the simulations.},

abstract = {This paper investigates whether a driver's useful field of view (UFOV) can be measured during normal driving tasks without the driver being aware of the system. We were able to develop an online method to measure the driver's UFOV (oUFOV) automatically using a real car driving test, in the city of Tampere. The system was merged with two different technical solutions that estimated if the driver paid attention to the traffic objects that appeared in his or her peripheral vision. Here, the original laboratory method using a PC display was expanded to monitor the driver for much longer periods. By incorporating the oUFOV method into a driving simulation environment in Japan, we were also able to conduct safer tests for the drivers with reduced visual conditions, such as the driver's mental status change (hasty driving), and replace more accurate control parameters with simulation software in cases of risky driving scenarios. Thus, we confirmed that the oUFOV can measure the visual conditions for the driver and be deployed as a real-time driver support system with an automatic intrusive HMI adaptation function or immediate alarming, in the future, without driver awareness, according to the driver's visual attention capability.},

abstract = {This paper deals with learning in reactive multi-agent systems. The central problem addressed is how several agents can collectively learn to coordinate their actions such that they solve a given environmental task together. In approaching this problem, two important constraints have to be taken into consideration: the incompatibility constraint, that is, the fact that different actions may be mutually exclusive; and the local information constraint, that is, the fact that each agent typically knows only a fraction of its environment. The contents of the paper is as follows. First, the topic of learning in multi-agent systems is motivated (section 1). Then, two algorithms called ACE and AGE (standing for "ACtion Estimation " and "Action Group Estimation", respectively) for the reinforcement learning of appropriate sequences of action sets in multi agent systems are described (section 2). Next, experimental results illustrating the learning abilities of these algorithms are presented (section 3). Finally, the algorithms are discussed and an outlook on future research is provided (section 4).},

abstract = {We propose a mathematical framework for modeling and analyzing multi-hop control networks designed for systems consisting of multiple control loops closed over a multi-hop (wireless) communication network. We separate control, topology, routing, and scheduling and propose formal syntax and semantics for the dynamics of the composed system, providing an explicit translation of multi-hop control networks to switched systems. We propose formal models for analyzing robustness of multi-hop control networks, where data is exchanged through a multi-hop communication network subject to disruptions. When communication disruptions are long, compared to the speed of the control system, we propose to model them as permanent link failures. We show that the complexity of analyzing such failures is NP-hard, and discuss a way to overcome this limitation for practical cases using compositional analysis. For typical packet transmission errors, we propose a transient error model where links fail for one time slot independently of the past and of other links. We provide sufficient conditions for almost sure stability in presence of transient link failures, and give efficient decision procedures. We deal with errors that have random time span and show that, under some conditions, the permanent failure model can be used as a reliable abstraction. Our approach is compositional, namely it addresses the problem of designing scalable scheduling and routing policies for multiple control loops closed on the same multi-hop control network. We describe how the translation of multi-hop control networks to switched systems can be automated, and use it to solve control and networking co-design challenges in some representative examples, and to propose a scheduling solution in a mineral floatation control problem that can be implemented on a time triggered communication protocols for wireless networks.},

We show an instance of this framework, which combines two independent classes of glue operators, interaction models and priorities. The combination of interaction models and priorities is expressive enough to encompass heterogeneous interaction and execution. We show that separation between behavior and structure is instrumental for correctness-by-construction.

It makes this fascinating interdisciplinary topic, which to date was only documented in parts by specialized monographs, accessible to a broad readership. Numerous figures and problems with solutions help the reader to quickly understand and practice the presented concepts. This book is targeted at students of physics and traffic engineering and, more generally, also at students and professionals in computer science, mathematics, and interdisciplinary topics. It also offers material for project work in programming and simulation at college and university level.The main part, after presenting different categories of traffic data, is devoted to a mathematical description of the dynamics of traffic flow, covering macroscopic models which describe traffic in terms of density, as well as microscopic many-particle models in which each particle corresponds to a vehicle and its driver. Focus chapters on traffic instabilities and model calibration/validation present these topics in a novel and systematic way. Finally, the theoretical framework is shown at work in selected applications such as traffic-state and travel-time estimation, intelligent transportation systems, traffic operations management, and a detailed physics-based model for fuel consumption and emissions.},

Dependency of performance on schedules can be formally modeled by an automaton (omega-regular language) which captures all the schedules that keep the system within performance requirements. We show how such an automaton is constructed for linear control designs and exponential stability or settling time performance requirements. Then, we explore the use of the automaton for online scheduling and for schedulability analysis. As a case study, we examine how this approach can be applied for the LQG control design. We demonstrate, by examples, that online schedulers can be used to guarantee performance in worst-case condition together with good performance in normal conditions. We also provide examples of schedulability analysis.},

abstract = {We present a framework for component-based design and scheduling of real-time embedded software. Each component has a clearly specified interface that includes the methods used for sensing, computation, and actuation, along with a requirement given as a regular set of macro-schedules. Each macro-schedule is an infinite sequence that specifies, for ev- ery time slot, the set of component methods invoked in that slot. The macro-scheduler composes the specifications of all the components, along with the platform specification that constrains which methods can be executed within a single slot, to generate a feasible macro-schedule. Within a slot, we use logical execution time semantics, and thismicro- scheduling is implemented on top of a native priority-based scheduler. With this approach, each component can be spec- ified and analyzed in a platform-independent way, and at the same time, the performance can vary with changing load and changing processing speed. We describe an implementation using Real-Time Java. Scheduling specifications can be given as periodic tasks, or using temporal logic, or as omega-automata. Components can be added dynamically, and non-real-time components are allowed. We demonstrate the benefits of the approach using case studies.},

abstract = {UML is the de-facto standard formalism for software design and analysis. To support the design of large-scale industrial applications, sophisticated CASE tools are available on the market, that provide a user-friendly environment for editing, storing, and accessing multiple UML diagrams. It would be highly desirable to equip such CASE tools with automated reasoning capabilities, such as those studied in Artificial Intelligence and, in particular, in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. Such capabilities would allow to automatically detect relevant formal properties of UML diagrams, such as inconsistencies or redundancies. With regard to this issue, we consider UML class diagrams, which are one of the most important components of UML, and we address the problem of reasoning on such diagrams. We resort to several results developed in the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, regarding Description Logics (DLs), a family of logics that admit decidable reasoning procedures. Our first contribution is to show that reasoning on UML class diagrams is EXPTIME-hard, even under restrictive assumptions; we prove this result by showing a polynomial reduction from reasoning in DLs. The second contribution consists in establishing EXPTIME-membership of reasoning on UML class diagrams, provided that the use of arbitrary OCL (first-order) constraints is disallowed. We get this result by using DLR ifd, a very expressive EXPTIME-decidable DL that has been developed to capture typical features of conceptual and object-oriented data models. The last contribution has a more practical flavor, and consists in a polynomial encoding of UML class diagrams in the DL ALCQI , which essentially is the most expressive DL supported by current state-of-the-art DL-based reasoning systems. Though less expressive than DLR ifd, the DL ALCQI preserves enough semantics to keep reasoning about UML class diagrams sound and complete. Exploiting such an encoding, one can use current DL-based reasoning systems as core reasoning engines for a next generation of CASE tools, that are equipped with reasoning capabilities on UML class diagrams},

Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers {\&} results.},

abstract = {It has been long known that fusing information from multiple sensors for robot navigation results in increased robustness and accuracy. However, accurate calibration of the sensor ensemble prior to deployment in the field as well as coping with sensor outages, different measurement rates and delays, render multi-sensor fusion a challenge. As a result, most often, systems do not exploit all the sensor information available in exchange for simplicity. For example, on a mission requiring transition of the robot from indoors to outdoors, it is the norm to ignore the Global Positioning System (GPS) signals which become freely available once outdoors and instead, rely only on sensor feeds (e.g., vision and laser) continuously available throughout the mission. Naturally, this comes at the expense of robustness and accuracy in real deployment. This paper presents a generic framework, dubbed MultiSensor-Fusion Extended Kalman Filter (MSF-EKF), able to process delayed, relative and absolute measurements from a theoretically unlimited number of different sensors and sensor types, while allowing self-calibration of the sensor-suite online. The modularity of MSF-EKF allows seamless handling of additional/lost sensor signals during operation while employing a state buffering scheme augmented with Iterated EKF (IEKF) updates to allow for efficient re-linearization of the prediction to get near optimal linearization points for both absolute and relative state updates. We demonstrate our approach in outdoor navigation experiments using a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) equipped with a GPS receiver as well as visual, inertial, and pressure sensors.},

@book{Brambilla2012,
abstract = {Abstract This book discusses how model-based approaches can improve the daily practice of software professionals. This is known as Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) or, simply, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). MDSE practices have proved to increase efficiency and effectiveness in software development, as demonstrated by various quantitative and qualitative studies. MDSE adoption in the software industry is foreseen to grow exponentially in the near future, e.g., due to the convergence of software development and business analysis. The aim of this book is to provide you with an agile and flexible tool to introduce you to the MDSE world, thus allowing you to quickly understand its basic principles and techniques and to choose the right set of MDSE instruments for your needs so that you can start to benefit from MDSE right away. The book is organized into two main parts. The first part discusses the foundations of MDSE in terms of basic concepts (i.e., models and transformations), driving principles, application scenarios and current standards, like the well-known MDA initiative proposed by OMG (Object Management Group) as well as the practices on how to integrate MDSE in existing development processes. The second part deals with the technical aspects of MDSE, spanning from the basics on when and how to build a domain-specific modeling language, to the description of Model-to-Text and Model-to-Model transformations, and the tools that support the management of MDSE projects. The book is targeted to a diverse set of readers, spanning: professionals, CTOs, CIOs, and team managers that need to have a bird's eye vision on the matter, so as to take the appropriate decisions when it comes to choosing the best development techniques for their company or team; software analysts, developers, or designers that expect to use MDSE for improving everyday work productivity, either by applying the basic modeling techniques and notations or by defining new domain-specific modeling languages and applying end-to-end MDSE practices in the software factory; and academic teachers and students to address undergrad and postgrad courses on MDSE. In addition to the contents of the book, more resources are provided on the book's website, including the examples presented in the book.

abstract = {Visual control of flight speed in honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) was investigated by training them to fly through a specially constructed tunnel in which the motion, contrast and texture of the patterns lining the walls could be varied. Manipulation of pattern motion revealed that the speed of flight is controlled by regulating the image motion that is experienced by the eyes. Flight speed is surprisingly robust to changes in the contrast and/or spatial texture of the visual environment, suggesting that the underlying movement-detecting mechanisms estimate the speed of image motion in the eye largely independently of these parameters. This ensures that flight speed depends primarily on the distances to nearby surfaces and not upon their particular visual properties, such as contrast or visual texture. The removal of image motion cues drastically compromises the regulation of flight speed, underscoring their role in this function.},

abstract = {We report two experiments designed to investigate the potential use of vibrotactile warning signals to present spatial information to car drivers. Participants performed an attention-demanding rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) monitoring task. Meanwhile, whenever they felt a vibrotactile stimulus presented on either their front or back, they had to check the front and the rearview mirror for the rapid approach of a car, and brake or accelerate accordingly. We investigated whether speeded responses to potential emergency driving situations could be facilitated by the presentation of spatially-predictive (80{\%} valid; Experiment 1) or spatially-nonpredictive (50{\%} valid; Experiment 2) vibrotactile cues. Participants responded significantly more rapidly following both spatially-predictive and spatially-nonpredictive vibrotactile cues from the same rather than the opposite direction as the critical driving events. These results highlight the potential utility of vibrotactile warning signals in automobile interface design for directing a driver's visual attention to time-critical events or information. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Within the research on Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), the field on flight control and autonomous mission execution is one of the most active. A crucial point is the localization of the vehicle, which is especially difficult in unknown, GPS-denied environments. This paper presents a novel vision based approach, where the vehicle is localized using a downward looking monocular camera. A state-of-the-art visual SLAM algorithm tracks the pose of the camera, while, simultaneously, building an incremental map of the surrounding region. Based on this pose estimation a LQG/LTR based controller stabilizes the vehicle at a desired setpoint, making simple maneuvers possible like take-off, hovering, setpoint following or landing. Experimental data show that this approach efficiently controls a helicopter while navigating through an unknown and unstructured environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work describing a micro aerial vehicle able to navigate through an unexplored environment (independently of any external aid like GPS or artificial beacons), which uses a single camera as only exteroceptive sensor.},

In Experiment 2, the authors examined task bandwidth and complexity, while introducing infrequent traffic hazards. Overall, task priority had a significant impact on scanning; however, the impact of increasing bandwidth was varied, depending on whether the relevant task was supported by focal (e.g., in-vehicle tasks; increased scanning) or ambient vision (e.g., lane keeping; no increase in scanning). The computational model accounted for approximately 95{\%} of the variance in scanning across both experiments.},

abstract = {UML is the de-facto standard formalism for software design and analysis. To support the design of large-scale industrial applications, sophisticated CASE tools are available on the market, that provide a user-friendly environment for editing, storing, and accessing multiple UML diagrams. It would be highly desirable to equip such CASE tools with automated reasoning capabilities, such as those studied in Artificial Intelligence and, in particular, in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. Such capabilities would allow to automatically detect relevant formal properties of UML diagrams, such as inconsistencies or redundancies. With regard to this issue, we consider UML class diagrams, which are one of the most important components of UML, and we address the problem of reasoning on such diagrams. We resort to several results developed in the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, regarding Description Logics (DLs), a family of logics that admit decidable reasoning procedures. Our first contribution is to show that reasoning on UML class diagrams is EXPTIME-hard, even under restrictive assumptions; we prove this result by showing a polynomial reduction from reasoning in DLs. The second contribution consists in establishing EXPTIME-membership of reasoning on UML class diagrams, provided that the use of arbitrary OCL (first-order) constraints is disallowed. We get this result by using DLRifd, a very expressive EXPTIME-decidable DL that has been developed to capture typical features of conceptual and object-oriented data models. The last contribution has a more practical flavor, and consists in a polynomial encoding of UML class diagrams in the DL ALCQI, which essentially is the most expressive DL supported by current state-of-the-art DL-based reasoning systems. Though less expressive than DLRifd, the DL ALCQI preserves enough semantics to keep reasoning about UML class diagrams sound and complete. Exploiting such an encoding, one can use current DL-based reasoning systems as core reasoning engines for a next generation of CASE tools, that are equipped with reasoning capabilities on UML class diagrams. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {While message sequence charts (MSCs) are widely used in industry to document the interworking of processes or objects, they are expressively weak, being based on the modest semantic notion of a partial ordering of events as defined, e.g., in the ITU standard. A highly expressive and rigorously defined MSC language is a must for serious, semantically meaningful tool support for use-cases and scenarios. It is also a prerequisite to addressing what we regard as one of the central problems in behavioral specification of systems: relating scenario-based inter-object specification to state-machine intra-object specification. This paper proposes an extension of MSCs, which we call live sequence charts (or LSCs), since our main extension deals with specifying liveness, i.e., things that must occur. In fact, LSCs allow the distinction between possible and necessary behavior both globally, on the level of an entire chart and locally, when specifying events, conditions and progress over time within a chart. This makes it possible to specify forbidden scenarios, for example, and enables naturally specified structuring constructs such as subcharts, branching and iteration.},

abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the difference in driving performance between drivers' attention on the head-up display (HUD)/road under low/high road conditions via a driving simulator experiment. Experimental driving included four driving scenarios with attention-on-the-HUD followed by attention-on-the-road or vice versa under high or low driving load conditions. Each scenario took about a 30-min driving consisting of two 15-min sections for each attention location. Forty-eight participants, divided into four groups, drove one of the four scenarios once. Besides driving safely within speed limit, participants were also required to perform detection task and speed limit sign response task. Results revealed that drivers paying attention to the HUD, under both low and high driving load conditions, reacted faster to speed limit sign changes than when paying attention to the road. In addition, attention-to-the-HUD under low driving load condition caused the smallest variation in steering wheel angle and lateral acceleration. These differences can be attributed to the driver's enhanced awareness and the cognitive capture effect, and tended to diminish with increasing driving workload. Finally, attention shift of drivers and the so-called novelty effect for using new technology product were also found. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This thesis presents the design, implementation, and validation of a system that enables a micro air vehicle to autonomously explore and map unstructured and unknown indoor environments. Such a vehiclewould be of considerable use inmany real-world applications such as search and rescue, civil engineering inspection, and a host of military tasks where it is dangerous or difficult to send people. While mapping and exploration capabilities are common for ground vehicles today, air vehicles seeking to achieve these capabilities face unique challenges. While there has been recent progress toward sensing, control, and navigation suites for GPS-denied flight, there have been few demonstrations of stable, goal-directed flight in real environments. The main focus of this research is the development of real-time state estimation tech- niques that allow our quadrotor helicopter to fly autonomously in indoor, GPS-denied en- vironments. Accomplishing this feat required the development of a large integrated system that brought together many components into a cohesive package. As such, the primary contribution is the development of the complete working system. I show experimental re- sults that illustrate theMAVs ability to navigate accurately in unknown environments, and demonstrate that our algorithms enable the MAV to operate autonomously in a variety of indoor environments.},

abstract = {Dynamic Systems Biology Modeling and Simuation consolidates and unifies classical and contemporary multiscale methodologies for mathematical modeling and computer simulation of dynamic biological systems - from molecular/cellular, organ-system, on up to population levels. The book pedagogy is developed as a well-annotated, systematic tutorial - with clearly spelled-out and unified nomenclature - derived from the author's own modeling efforts, publications and teaching over half a century. Ambiguities in some concepts and tools are clarified and others are rendered more accessible and practical. The latter include novel qualitative theory and methodologies for recognizing dynamical signatures in data using structural (multicompartmental and network) models and graph theory; and analyzing structural and measurement (data) models for quantification feasibility. The level is basic-to-intermediate, with much emphasis on biomodeling from real biodata, for use in real applications.Introductory coverage of core mathematical concepts such as linear and nonlinear differential and difference equations, Laplace transforms, linear algebra, probability, statistics and stochastics topics; PLUS .......The pertinent biology, biochemistry, biophysics or pharmacology for modeling are provided, to support understanding the amalgam of “math modeling” with life sciences.Strong emphasis on quantifying as well as building and analyzing biomodels: includes methodology and computational tools for parameter identifiability and sensitivity analysis; parameter estimation from real data; model distinguishability and simplification; and practical bioexperiment design and optimization.Companion website provides solutions and program code for examples and exercises using Matlab, Simulink, VisSim, SimBiology, SAAMII, AMIGO, Copasi and SBML-coded models.A full set of PowerPoint slides are available from the author for teaching from his textbook. He uses them to teach a 10 week quarter upper division course at UCLA, which meets twice a week, so there are 20 lectures. They can easily be augmented or stretched for a 15 week semester course. Importantly, the slides are editable, so they can be readily adapted to a lecturer's personal style and course content needs. The lectures are based on excerpts from 12 of the first 13 chapters of DSBMS. They are designed to highlight the key course material, as a study guide and structure for students following the full text content. The complete PowerPoint slide package ({\~{}}25 MB) can be obtained by instructors (or prospective instructors) by emailing the author directly, at: joed@cs.ucla.edu},

abstract = {There is currently a limited diversity of vehicles capable of Vertical Take-Off and Landing. However there is a visible interest by scholars and admirers of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for a particular type of aircraft called quadrotor. This work aims precisely at the design and control of a quadrotor prototype having a tri-axis accelerometer and a compass as its sensors. This project started with the design of the quadrotor having in mind a list of objectives to be fulfilled by it. Then followed the modeling of the dynamics and kinematics of the aircraft's motion, as well as of its motors and sensors. This led to the implementation of the quadrotor in a computer simulation environment called Simulink{\textregistered}. Given the outputs provided by the available sensors, a Kalman filter was developed capable of estimating the angular velocities and Euler angles of the quadrotor, being therefore possible to have knowledge of its attitude. This filter was combined with a Linear-Quadratic Regulator in order to make the system follow a given attitude reference. Finally, the results of the simulations and real implementation in the quadrotor are presented.},

abstract = {Real-Time Embedded Systems (RTESs) have an increasing role in controlling the IT that we use on a day-to-day basis. The behaviour of an RTES is not based solely on the interactions it might have with its surrounding environment, but also on the timing requirements it induces. As a result, ensuring that an RTES behaves correctly is non-trivial, especially after adding time as a new dimension to the complexity of the testing process. We previously introduced the 'priority-based' approach which tests the logical and timing behaviour of an RTES modelled formally as UPPAAL automata. The 'priority-based' approach was based on producing sets of timed test traces by achieving clock region coverage. In this paper, we empirically validate the 'priority-based' approach with comparison to well-known timed testing approaches based on a Timed Automata (TA) formalism using a complete test bed based on an industrial-strength case study (production cell). The validation assessment is based on both fault coverage and structural coverage by a minimal number of generated test traces; the former is achieved using the Mutation Analysis Technique (MAT) by introducing a set of timed and functional mutation operators. The latter is based on clock region coverage as a main timed structural coverage criterion. This study shows that 'priority-based' approach can combine a high fault coverage and clock region coverage with a relatively small number of test traces in comparison with other test approaches. A set of experiences and lessons learned are highlighted as result of the real-time test bed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {As we are moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of sensors deployed around the world is growing at a rapid pace. Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.},

abstract = {Hybrid systems with both discrete and continuous dynamics are an important model for real-world cyber-physical systems. The key challenge is to ensure their correct functioning w.r.t. safety requirements. Promising techniques to ensure safety seem to be model-driven engineering to develop hybrid systems in a well-defined and traceable manner, and formal verification to prove their correctness. Their combination forms the vision of verification-driven engineering. Often, hybrid systems are rather complex in that they require expertise from many domains (e. g., robotics, control systems, computer science, software engineering, and mechanical engineering). Moreover, despite the remarkable progress in automating formal verification of hybrid systems, the construction of proofs of complex systems often requires nontrivial human guidance, since hybrid systems verification tools solve undecidable problems. It is, thus, not uncommon for development and verification teams to consist of many players with diverse expertise. This paper introduces a verification-driven engineering toolset that extends our previous work on hybrid and arithmetic verification with tools for (1) graphical (UML) and textual modeling of hybrid systems, (2) exchanging and comparing models and proofs, and (3) managing verification tasks. This toolset makes it easier to tackle large-scale verification tasks. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Basel.},

We model hybrid systems as finite automata equipped with variables that evolve continuously with time according to dynamical laws. For verification purposes, we restrict ourselves to linear hybrid systems, where all variables follow piecewise-linear trajectories. We provide decidability and undecidability results for classes of linear hybrid systems, and we show that standard program-analysis techniques can be adapted to linear hybrid systems. In particular, we consider symbolic model-checking and minimization procedures that are based on the reachability analysis of an infinite state space. The procedures iteratively compute state sets that are definable as unions of convex polyhedra in multidimensional real space. We also present approximation techniques for dealing with systems for which the iterative procedures do not converge.},

CPS also requires demanding real time property. However, unified modeling of continuous and discrete variables is still an unsolved problem in the CPS development. In this paper we propose an extended UML state chart, Spatio-Temporal UML state chart for Cyber-Physical Systems (STUML State chart). This state chart is based on the UML Profile for Modeling and Analysis of Real-time and Embedded (MARTE) systems. In STUML State charts, we unify the logical time and the chronometric time variables, and extend the traditional events to CPS events. Based on MARTE and hybrid automata, we improve the STUML state chart, and based on Labeled Transition Systems, we define formal syntax and semantics of STUML state charts. At the end of this paper, an Intelligent Transportation System is employed as an example to show how to model the system behavior with STUML state charts. {\textcopyright} 2012 C.E.S.A.M.E.S.},
